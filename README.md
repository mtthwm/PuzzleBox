## Description
This is a project built for our ECE 5780 (Embedded Systems) final project. We built a puzzle box that requires the user to interact with it in novel ways to unlock and reveal the prize inside. 

### Puzzle 1: Knock and Response 

The buzzer plays a common knock rhythm, and the user must respond to finish the rhythm. 

### Puzzle 2:  

Led on sides of the box lights up, rotate the whole box so the LED points down. Repeat 3ish times with a random side each time. 

### Puzzle 3: 

Using multiple photoresistors, a sequence of holes needs to either be lit or covered.  

### Puzzle Completion: 

Using a servo, unlock the box for opening. Puzzle restarts on close.
